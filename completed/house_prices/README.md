##This is a regression case study based on a Kaggle challenge about predicting house prices in California during the 90s.
##To solve it, I used three regression models (linear, decision tree, and random forest) and then applied cross-validation to validate the results.
##To optimize the process and make it more efficient, I used a personalized pipeline.
##Also, to improve and optimize the model results, I used GridSearchCV.
##As it is a regression model, I used a few literature-based metrics, like RMSE, to evaluate the model's results.
##In the path: house_prices/code/pre_processing, you'll find a Jupyter notebook with the code commented in Portuguese.
